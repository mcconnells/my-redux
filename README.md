# My Redux


This is my experiment with the react-redux-starter-kit.

Install Node

```bash
$ npm install redux-cli â€“g
$ redux new my-redux
$ cd my-redux
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Install the redux-cli command line tool, use it to create a new sample react/redux project, go into the project directory install and start.
Open Chrome on localhost:3000 to see the app. Open the folder in Atom and start playing around.
