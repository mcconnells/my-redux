# My Redux


This is my experiment with the react-redux-starter-kit.

Install Node, then use npm to install the redux-cli command line tool, use it to create a new sample react/redux project, go into the created project directory, run npm install and npm start commands.

```bash
$ npm install redux-cli â€“g
$ redux new my-redux
$ cd my-redux
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Open Chrome on localhost:3000 to see the app. Open the folder in Atom and start playing around.
